# Features and Issues

- [ ] Exlude node_modules folders always
- [ ] Allow an exclusion list to be specified in launch.config.json
- [ ] Create default port, console, etc in launch.json, unless overrulled by launch.config.json
- [ ] If executed and a launch.config.json files does not yet exist, then create it with default port, console, etc, so
      that it is easier for the user to customize later.
